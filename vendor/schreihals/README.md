Everybody should be developing their own blogging engine for hackers, so here's mine.
Documentation is pretty minimal at the moment, so for now, how about a list of
overall design goals?

## Overall Design Goals

* Minimal code design.
* Author your blog through git, using Markdown and friends.
* Near-zero boilerplate code in your blog project. (It's all in the gem.)
* Theme support through gems.
* No static document generation. (Not interested, there are enough engines out there that do this.)
* HAML and SASS support out of the box.

## Usage

TODO: soon
