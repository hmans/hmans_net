This is the source code for my new blog, [hmans.net](http://hmans.net).

**Important Note:** I'm in the process of extracting a cool new blogging tool called **Schreihals** as well as a lightweight CSS library called **Schnitzelstyle** from this project; however, for the time being, these guys are bundled inside this project's `vendor/` directory. In other words, you can't really use them yet, unless you want to go crazy and fork this very repository. (Be my guest, but I recommend you wait for the first release of these libraries. It's just a matter of days now. I hope. :b)
